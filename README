TWISSJAVA: Twitter on Cassandra in Java.

Deps:
 + Maven: this will load our build deps.
   + Cassandra 0.6: the important thing.
   + Pelops: this is how we talk to the important thing.
   + Wicket: this is how we show other people the important thing.

Setup:
 + Install Cassandra 0.6 from http://cassandra.apache.org/ as well
    as its dependencies (Thrift). Copy the storage_conf.xml over
    the default configuration and then start bin/cassandra.
 + Install Pelops from http://code.google.com/p/pelops/ .
 + Install Wicket with default packages and structure:
   `mvn archetype:create 
     -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket 
     -DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart 
     -DarchetypeVersion=1.4.9 
     -DgroupId=example 
     -DartifactId=twissjava`
 + Replace default files in the Wicket heirarchy with Twissjava 
    files from this checkout.
 + Compile everything.
 + java src/test/java/example/Start.java (starts Jetty, the appserver
    that comes with Wicket)
 + localhost:8080
